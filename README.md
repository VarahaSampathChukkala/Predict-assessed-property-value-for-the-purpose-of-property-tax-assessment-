# Predict-assessed-property-value-for-the-purpose-of-property-tax-assessment-
## Problem Description:
The Municipal council is facing the problem of many citizens challenging the assessment of property taxes and is criticized for complicated assessment procedure system as well as multiple required filings throughout the year to challenge oneâ€™s assessment. Therefore, the Council wants to rationalise the tax assessment system. They also want to structure benefit programs based on certain variables of statistical significance to incentivise additional construction activity or activity of conversion/modification of properties for reducing tax burden and/or to make the contemplated projects more economically feasible. 
 
Therefore the idea is to achieve consistent, rational and objective assessment of properties based on a predictive model by automating the property valuation process to reduce the unfairness within the tax system
